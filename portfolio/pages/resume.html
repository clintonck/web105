            <h5>Background</h5>
            <p>
                I previously worked in manufacturing and sales as a lead associate and worked incrementally
                as a programmer and designer for 6 years. Since then, I have been 
                self-employed for 4 years. I work in development, sales, transportation,
                and stock trading. I attribute a great deal of my experience and success
                to managing my own business. Among my clients are Juke Technologies,
                Drawing Mystic, and Uber. I am proficient with a variety of business programs 
                including Microsoft Office, QuickBooks, and Webull. For programming, I use 
                Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and Pycharm. As a music producer, I work on Reason Studios.
                I also use Adobe Creative Suite for design.
            </p>  
            <h5>Education</h5>
            <p> I graduated from Cary-Grove High School for general studies in 2007. I am a self-taught
                entrepreneur who has gained knowledge in sales and online services. I eventually returned 
                to school to study business and computer science. I learned business management, marketing,
                and communications. I achieved an Associates of Arts in 2021 and have continued advancing
                in writing code. I intend to finish a Programming Fundamentals Certificate
                and pursue a degree in Software Engineering.
